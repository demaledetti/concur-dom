# Concur - Dom backend

A [Concur](https://github.com/ajnsit/concur) Haskell backend targeting web browsers via [GHC JS backend](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/javascript.html), using real DOM node diffing from [nanomorph](https://github.com/choojs/nanomorph).

This is a port of [concur-vdom](https://github.com/ajnsit/concur/tree/master/concur-vdom). The initial commit is meant to minimize the diff from the original concur-vdom code for ease of comparison and transition. Further commits might diverge more.

See the `cabal.project` file for help getting this to build.
